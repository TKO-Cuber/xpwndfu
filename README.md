# XPWNDFU

XPWNDFU is a bash wrapper for ipwndfu, an untethered jailbreaking tool for older devices.

XPWNDFU makes setting up ipwndfu easier.
It automatically downloads the 4.3.5 iBSS and other dependencies.

I've also added an option for verbose booting your new BootROM iPhone 3GS, something the original ipwndfu doesn't have.
This is my fork of XPWNDFU
