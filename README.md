# XPWNDFU

XPWNDFU is a bash wrapper for ipwndfu, an untethered jailbreaking tool for older devices.

XPWNDFU adds options missing from the official ipwndfu, makes the interface look nicer, and makes the setup process easier.
It automatically downloads the 4.3.5 iBSS and other dependencies.

I've also added an option for verbose booting your new BootROM iPhone 3GS, something the original ipwndfu doesn't have.
This is my fork of XPWNDFU

This fork of XPWNDFU is downloaded when restoring a custom firmware using my program Eth3r to allow for verbose boot without including iBSS patches in Eth3r itself.
